      if n % 2 == 0:
          return (sorted_data[n // 2 - 1] + sorted_data[n // 2]) / 2
      else:
          return sorted_data[n // 2]
  ```

- **Application Scenarios**: Provide more accurate typical performance when outliers exist

### **2. Measures of Variability**

## 📊 **Inferential Statistics**

Inferential statistics are used to infer population characteristics from sample data, scientifically comparing performance differences between Rust and TinyGo in the project.

### **🎯 Why Inferential Statistics Are Essential: Core Challenge Analysis**

In WebAssembly benchmarking, inferential statistics solve a fundamental problem:

> **How to scientifically distinguish real language performance differences from random measurement fluctuations in noisy performance data?**

#### **Risk Scenarios Without Inferential Statistics**

```text
❌ Dangerous decision path:
Rust test results: [45.2ms, 46.1ms, 44.8ms, 45.5ms, 46.0ms] → Average: 45.52ms
TinyGo test results: [47.1ms, 46.8ms, 47.3ms, 46.9ms, 47.2ms] → Average: 47.06ms

Simple conclusion: "Rust is 1.54ms faster than TinyGo, we should choose Rust!"
⚠️  But this difference might be completely random!
```

#### **Solutions Provided by Inferential Statistics**

- **Scientific Validation**: Establish statistical framework to verify authenticity of differences
- **Risk Control**: Quantify uncertainty and risk of decisions
- **Standardized Decisions**: Provide objective comparison standards and thresholds

### **1. Hypothesis Testing**

#### **🔬 Why Hypothesis Testing Is Needed: Establishing Scientific Comparison Framework**

**Core Problem**: Distinguish real differences vs random noise

In performance testing, we always observe some differences between Rust and TinyGo, but the key question is:
> **Are these differences real performance differences, or caused by measurement errors, system load changes, random fluctuations?**

**Scientific Framework Provided by Hypothesis Testing**:

```javascript
// Logic framework of hypothesis testing
H0 (null hypothesis): μ_Rust = μ_TinyGo  (both languages have same performance)
H1 (alternative hypothesis): μ_Rust ≠ μ_TinyGo  (real performance difference exists)

// Testing through Welch's t-test
const result = StatisticalValidator.performWelchTTest(rustTimes, tinygoTimes);
```

**Practical Application Value**:

1. **Avoid Wrong Decisions**: Prevent technology selection based on accidental fluctuations
2. **Quantify Uncertainty**: Clearly state reliability of decisions
3. **Standardize Process**: Provide consistent methods for different task comparisons
4. **Team Communication**: Provide objective discussion foundation

#### **Welch's t-test**

- **Definition**: Statistical test comparing means of two samples that may have unequal variances
- **Advantages**: More robust than standard t-test, suitable for unequal variance situations
- **Project Role**: Scientifically compare performance differences between Rust and TinyGo
- **Implementation Location**: `analysis/statistics.py:64-125`
- **Core Code**:

  ```python
  def welch_t_test(self, group1: list[float], group2: list[float]) -> TTestResult:
      # Calculate sample statistics
      n1, mean1, var1 = self._get_basic_stats(group1)
      n2, mean2, var2 = self._get_basic_stats(group2)

      # Welch's t-statistic: t = (μ₁ - μ₂) / √(s₁²/n₁ + s₂²/n₂)
      standard_error = math.sqrt(var1 / n1 + var2 / n2)
      t_statistic = (mean1 - mean2) / standard_error

      # Welch-Satterthwaite degrees of freedom
      degrees_freedom = self._calculate_welch_degrees_freedom(var1, var2, n1, n2)

      # Use scipy to calculate accurate two-tailed p-value
      p_value = 2 * (1 - t_dist.cdf(abs(t_statistic), degrees_freedom))
  ```

- **t-statistic Interpretation**:
  - |t| > 2: Possible significant difference
  - |t| > 3: Likely significant difference
- **Application Scenarios**: Determine if performance differences between two compilers are statistically significant

#### **Degrees of Freedom**

- **Definition**: Number of independent parameters that can vary in statistical tests
- **Welch Method**: Uses Welch-Satterthwaite correction formula
- **Project Role**: Affects accuracy of critical values and p-value calculations
- **Implementation**: Adapts to unequal variance situations, improves test accuracy

### **2. Significance Testing**

#### **📊 Why Significance Testing Is Needed: Quantify Statistical Confidence**

**Core Problem**: How confident are we in the results?

Significance testing answers a key question through **p-values**:
> **If the two languages really have no performance difference, what's the probability of observing our current results (or more extreme results)?**

#### **Practical Meaning of p-values**

```javascript
// Hypothesis testing result example
{
  tStatistic: -3.247,
  pValue: 0.0031,        // Key indicator
  isSignificant: true,   // p < 0.05
  meanDifference: -1.54, // Rust 1.54ms faster on average
  confidenceInterval: [-2.67, -0.41]
}
```

**Interpretation**: `p = 0.0031` means: If Rust and TinyGo really have no performance difference, the probability of observing a 1.54ms or larger difference is only 0.31%, which is a very small probability, so we have reason to believe there is a real performance difference.

#### **Decision Guidance for Different p-values**

| p-value Range | Statistical Conclusion | Practical Decision Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| p ≥ 0.05 | No significant difference | Performance similar, choose based on other factors |
| 0.01 ≤ p < 0.05 | Moderate evidence | Difference exists but consider effect size |
| 0.001 ≤ p < 0.01 | Strong evidence | Likely real difference exists |
| p < 0.001 | Very strong evidence | Almost certain difference exists |

#### **⚠️ Limitations of Significance Testing**

```text
Case: "Significant but meaningless" results with large samples
- Test 10000 times, Rust 0.001ms faster on average
- p < 0.001 (highly significant)
- But 0.001ms difference is completely negligible in practice
```

**Important Warning**: Significance ≠ Practical Importance

#### **p-value**

- **Definition**: Probability of observing current results or more extreme results when null hypothesis is true
- **Interpretation**:
  - p < 0.001: Very strong evidence of difference
  - p < 0.01: Strong evidence of difference
  - p < 0.05: Moderate evidence of difference
  - p ≥ 0.05: Insufficient evidence of difference
- **Project Role**: Determine statistical significance of Rust vs TinyGo performance differences
- **Implementation Location**:

  ```python
  # analysis/statistics.py:475 (using scipy for precise calculation)
  p_value = 2 * (1 - t_dist.cdf(abs_t, df))
  ```

#### **Significance Level (Alpha/α)**

- **Definition**: Threshold probability for rejecting null hypothesis
- **Common Values**: 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), 0.001 (0.1%)
- **Project Setting**: Default 0.05
- **Meaning**: Control probability of Type I error (incorrectly rejecting null hypothesis)

#### **Confidence Interval**

- **Definition**: Interval range containing true parameter value, providing uncertainty quantification
- **Common Level**: 95% (corresponding to α=0.05)
- **Project Role**: Provide interval estimation for performance differences
- **Implementation Location**:

  ```python
  # analysis/statistics.py:538-578
  def _confidence_interval(self, group1: list[float], group2: list[float]) -> tuple[float, float]:
      # Use scipy to calculate precise critical values
      critical_t = float(t_dist.ppf(1 - alpha / 2, degrees_freedom))
      margin_of_error = critical_t * standard_error
      return (mean_difference - margin_of_error, mean_difference + margin_of_error)
  ```

- **Interpretation**: 95% confidence interval means that if experiment is repeated 100 times, approximately 95 intervals would contain the true difference value

### **3. Effect Size Analysis**

#### **💪 Why Effect Size Analysis Is Needed: Assess Practical Importance**

**Core Problem**: How large is the difference, is it worth attention?

Effect size answers questions that significance testing cannot:
> **Even if there is statistical significance, how important is this difference in practical application?**

#### **Practical Meaning of Cohen's d**

```javascript
// Effect size calculation example
const effectSize = StatisticalValidator.calculateCohenD(rustTimes, tinygoTimes);
console.log(effectSize);
// Output:
{
  cohenD: 0.73,
  magnitude: "medium",
  interpretation: "Medium effect size - Rust faster than TinyGo"
}
```

#### **Decision Guidance for Effect Sizes**

| Cohen's d | Effect Size | Practical Meaning | Decision Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| \|d\| < 0.2 | Negligible | Very small difference, negligible practical impact | Choose based on team familiarity |
| 0.2 ≤ \|d\| < 0.5 | Small effect | Some difference, but not decisive factor | Consider performance along with other factors |
| 0.5 ≤ \|d\| < 0.8 | Medium effect | Clear difference, performance becomes important | Prioritize faster option for performance-sensitive scenarios |
| \|d\| ≥ 0.8 | Large effect | Significant difference, performance difference obvious | Strongly recommend choosing better performing language |

#### **Specific Applications in Project**

```javascript
// Effect size analysis for different tasks
const taskAnalysis = {
  json_parse: {
    cohenD: 0.23,  // Small effect
    recommendation: "Small performance difference, choose familiar language"
  },
  matrix_mul: {
    cohenD: 1.15,  // Large effect
    recommendation: "Rust significantly faster, recommend for compute-intensive tasks"
  },
  mandelbrot: {
    cohenD: 0.67,  // Medium effect
    recommendation: "Rust has clear advantage, worth considering"
  }
};
```

#### **Cohen's d**

- **Definition**: Standardized effect size, quantifying actual size of difference between two groups
- **Formula**: `d = (μ₁ - μ₂) / σ_pooled`
- **Project Role**: Assess practical importance of performance differences, not just statistical significance
- **Implementation Location**: `analysis/statistics.py:127-194`
- **Interpretation Standards**:
  - |d| < 0.2: Negligible effect
  - 0.2 ≤ |d| < 0.5: Small effect
  - 0.5 ≤ |d| < 0.8: Medium effect
  - |d| ≥ 0.8: Large effect
- **Configuration Location**:

  ```yaml
  # configs/bench-quick.yaml:150
  effect_size_metric: "cohens_d"
  minimum_detectable_effect: 0.2  # Minimum detectable effect size
  ```

#### **Effect Size Thresholds**

- **Project Configuration**:

  ```yaml
  # configs/bench-quick.yaml:152-155
  effect_size_thresholds:
    small: 0.2
    medium: 0.5
    large: 0.8
  ```

- **Application Scenarios**: Determine if performance differences have practical significance

### **🎯 Synergistic Role of Three Components: Complete Decision Support System**

#### **Complete Decision Support Process**

```text
1. Hypothesis Testing → Does real difference exist?
   ↓
2. Significance Testing → How confident are we in this conclusion?
   ↓
3. Effect Size Analysis → How important is this difference in practice?
   ↓
4. Comprehensive Decision → Technology selection based on statistical evidence
```

#### **🛡️ Risk Control: Why All Three Are Necessary**

**Risks of Having Only One or Two**:

```text
❌ Descriptive statistics only (mean comparison):
→ Cannot distinguish real differences from random noise
→ May make wrong decisions based on accidental results

❌ Hypothesis testing + significance testing only:
→ May be misled by statistically significant but practically meaningless tiny differences
→ With large samples, tiny differences can be significant

❌ Effect size analysis only:
→ Cannot determine if observed differences are reliable
→ May be misled by large effect sizes produced by random fluctuations
```

**Value of Complete System**:

```text
✅ Three components working together:
→ Scientific Rigor: Hypothesis testing establishes framework
→ Confidence Quantification: Significance testing provides reliability
→ Practical Assessment: Effect size analysis evaluates importance
→ Risk Control: Multi-layer verification prevents wrong decisions
```

#### **Real Case Analysis**

```javascript
// Complete statistical analysis results
const analysisResult = {
  // 1. Hypothesis testing results
  hypothesis: {
    result: "reject_null",
    conclusion: "Significant performance difference exists"
  },

  // 2. Significance testing
  significance: {
    pValue: 0.0023,
    isSignificant: true,
    confidence: "Strong evidence supports performance difference"
  },

  // 3. Effect size analysis
  effectSize: {
    cohenD: 0.78,
    magnitude: "medium-to-large",
    practicalSignificance: "Difference large enough to consider in technology selection"
  },

  // 4. Comprehensive recommendation
  recommendation: {
    choice: "Rust",
    confidence: "High",
    reasoning: "Statistically significant and practically important performance advantage"
  }
};
```
